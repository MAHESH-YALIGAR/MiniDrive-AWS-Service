Welcome to MiniDrive, your personal cloud-based file storage and sharing system.
MiniDrive helps you store, share, organize, and manage your files securely — similar to Google Drive or Dropbox, but simple and efficient.

🌟 Key Features
1. 🔼 File Upload

You can upload documents, images, videos, and other file types.

Files are stored securely in the cloud (via S3 storage).

3. 🗑️ Trash Bin (Recover or Delete Permanently)

MiniDrive includes a Trash Bin for safety.
When you delete a file, it’s not removed immediately — it goes to Trash Bin.

Choose “Restore” to recover the file.

Choose “Delete Permanently” to remove it forever.
